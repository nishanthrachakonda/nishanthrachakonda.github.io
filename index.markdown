HI! I am software engineer at Google Cloud Networking. I have graduated from 
IIIT-H in 2021 with B.Tech(Hons) in Computer Science and Engineering. I am 
interested in action detection, video analysis and multimodal analysis.

I have worked in the field of two wheeler driving action detection problem during
my undergraduate research under [Prof C.V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/)
and [Dr. Rohit Saluja](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~rohitsaluja/). I have worked under 
[Prof. Jayanthi Sivaswamy](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/jsivaswamy/) in generalized image de-blurring.
